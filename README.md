# Smart Farm Website

Welcome to the Smart Farm Website project! This repository contains the code for a web application designed to help farmers manage their farms more efficiently using modern web technologies and artificial intelligence.

## Overview

The Smart Farm Website provides farmers with a user-friendly interface to control their farm's irrigation schedule, monitor the health of their crops, and detect diseases in the leaves using AI.

## Features

- **Irrigation Schedule Management**: Control and automate your farm's irrigation schedule with an easy-to-use interface.
- **Farm Health Monitoring**: Get detailed information about the health of each farm, including soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels.
- **AI-Based Leaf Disease Detection**: Upload images of leaves to check for diseases using advanced AI algorithms.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **Backend**: Developed with Python, responsible for controlling farm devices and managing schedules.
